    "Because the bond has a $10$ percent coupon rate and investors require a $12$ precent yield, we know that the bond must sell at a discount.

Finally, the bond matures in $20$ years, so there are a total of $40$ six-month periods. \n",

The reason is that the effective annual yield on the bond is $1.06^{2} - 1 = .1236$ or $12.36\\%$, not $12$ percent.

    "A corporate coupon bond carries an $8$ percent coupon, paid semiannually. The par value is $\\$1,000$, and the bond matures in six years. If the bond currently sells for $\\$911.37$, what is the yield to maturity? What is the effective annual yield? \n",

    "The present value of the bond's cash flows is its current price, $\\$911.37$. The coupon is $\\$40$ every six months for $12$ periods. The face value is $\\$1,000$. So the bond's yield is the unknown discount rate in the following: \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\$911.37 = \\$40 \\times \\frac{\\left[1 - \\frac{1}{(1 + r)^{12}}\\right]}{r} + \\frac{1,000}{(1 + r)^{12}}\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The bond sells at a discount. Because the coupon rate is $8$ percent, the yield must be something in excess of that. \n",

    "This is less than the actual value, so our discount rate is too high. We now know that the yield is somewhere between $8$ and $12$ percent. With further trial and error (or a little machine assistance), the yield works out to be $10$ percent, or $5$ percent every six months. \n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, the bond's yield to maturity would be quoted as $2 \\times 5\\% = 10\\%$. The effective annual yield is $1.05^{2} - 1 = .1025$ or $10.25\\%$.\n",
