Isaac: 3:05-3:26
Discussed plans to proceed, building main function of nuggets problem

David: 3:27 - 3:54
Finished nuggets problem, moved onto bond pricing. David completed one present value function, began the function using cashflows and passed to Isaac.

Isaac: 3:58 - 4:30
Finished bond pricing with cashflows and checked our answers. Then coded Problem 4 using our experience with problems 2 & 3, went much smoother than the first few. Have some troubleshooting
